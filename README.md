# Midterm-Project---JellyLegs
Most of our project outline and progress throughout the building process is documented in Hatim's repository which is linked below. This repository will mainly focus on a more detailed elaboration on the building process of the JellyBot's legs, or as I call it, the JellyLegs.

The first thing I did was 8 equally sized pieces of cardboard that were 30cm long. I cut a hole about three cm into the plank of cardboard in which to mark where the servo will go. I measured out the size of the servo and cut a whole in which to insert it in 4 of the cardboard pieces. These would act as the "thigh" of the JellyLeg on which the hinge (Servo) would be attached to. After finishing the legs, I realized that it was not robust and relatively flimsy so i reinforced the "thigh" with thicker and stronger planks of cardboard as shown in the image below

Below is the circuit diagram used in order to control the 4 servos in the legs through one arduino. I had to solder on 2 other sets of three pins to act as addition grounds, powers and signals forthe two extra servos

In order to connect the legs to the servos, i had to increase the length of the connecting wires. To do this, I cut addition wire and soldered one end to a male to male connector and another to a male to female connector. After that I used zip ties to tidy up the plethora of wires dangling across the JellyBot
